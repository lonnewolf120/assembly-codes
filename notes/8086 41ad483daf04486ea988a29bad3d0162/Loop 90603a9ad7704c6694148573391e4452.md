# Loop

We use CX register for looping, as CX is the count register, and we can define how many times we want continue the loop by assigning it the value

> loop and print all the characters in alphabet
> 

```nasm
mov cx, 26  ;loop 26 times
mov ah, 2
mov dl, 'A' 

level1:  ;the loop function
;it'll call everything after mov cx and execute it as ordered afterwards
int 21h     ;call the interrupt to print the characters
inc dl      ;increment the value in DL register
loop level1 ;loop till level1 is finished (specified in cx register)
```

- Nested Loop
    
    for a nested loop, we need to manipulate & store the CX registers values 
    
    ```nasm
    MOV CX, 5; Outer loop runs 5 times
    OuterLoop: 
       
       ; before heading to inner loop we need to save cx content
       MOV var1, CX
       MOV CX, var2   ;change CX according to innerloop 
      InnerLoop:
       
       
       
       LOOP InnerLoop
       MOV CX, var1 ; restore CX value
       ;we can also inc/dec var2 according to our needs
          
    LOOP OuterLoop   
    ```
