# 8086 achitecture

16 bit microprocessor

20 bit address bus, so it can address any one of 2^20 or 1,048,576 memory locations

the 8086 processor is divided into 2 parts :

BIU (Bus Interface unit) & EU(Execution unit)

**BIU**: It handles all transfers of data and addresses on the buses for the execution unit.

- Sends out addresses
- Fetches instructions from memory.
- Read / write data from/to ports and memory i.e. handles all transfers of data and addresses on the busses

**EU**

- Tells BIU where to fetch instructions or data from
- Decodes instructions
- Executes instructions

the Registers:
A,B,C,D â€”> General purpose registers  (AH, AL;  BH,BL;  CH, CL;  DH, DL)
