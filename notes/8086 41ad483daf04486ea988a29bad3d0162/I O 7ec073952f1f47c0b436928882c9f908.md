## Detailed:

and for input, we need to do :

```nasm
mov ah, 01h   ;take input into AL
int 21h       ;this is the interrupt
```

in order to print something the data to be printed has to be moved to DL register and then call the interrupt (int 21h):

```nasm
mov ah, 02h   ;call for printing
mov dl, al    ;dl = al
int 21h       ;print DL data
```

also in emu8086 we can simply print things by typing :

print ‘the data we wanna print’ 

it runs a program to automatically takes each of the characters here and print them..

### Printing Strings

```nasm
.model small
.stack 100h
.data
str db 'Hello World! $' ;dont forget the $ at the end of string
;str db 'Hello World!', 0 works similarly
.code
main proc
	mov ax,@data ;this @data segment will be converted for code later
	mov ds,ax    ;initialize the variables by moving them into data segment

	mov ah,9    ;print character string as output
	lea dx,str  ;DX = str, use DX instead of DL cause str needs more space
	int 21h
	
```
